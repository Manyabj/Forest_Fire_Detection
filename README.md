# Forest Fire Detection Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview  
Forest fires are one of the leading causes of environmental damage, threatening wildlife, human life, and the global climate. This project leverages **satellite imagery** and **deep learning models** to detect and classify forest fires automatically. By utilizing computer vision techniques, we aim to build an early-warning system to assist in disaster management and prevention.
